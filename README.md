# Food Truck Word Cloud

This project generates a word cloud of food truck menu items from truck permitting data in San Francisco, filtered to trucks open now. Some attempt will be made to provide prioritization given a starting point for the diner, but since geo-coding is slow from the street addresses given in the data set, this may not work well.
